# The DocBook Schemas

This repository contains the sources for the DocBook schemas. All of
the revision history from the Sourceforge days has been preserved.

"It's easier to ask for forgiveness than it is to get permission"

Norm initially moved the schema repository here as a private
experiment. It's turned out to be so useful that he's going to see if
he can get community buy-in to let him keep them here. He might not
succeed.
